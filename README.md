What dynamic drive value diversity, drift or convergence.

Civilization is a game you and I can’t ignore as far as the world at large is progressing. And the crucial role we play matters in terms of our action and inaction toward solving a particular problem or attaining and achieving a goal.
We tend to figure out a way that will surely benefit of outcome which most a time might not favour or be in accordance with other players (people) preference.  For instance, Mr. Roy might be want a world where he can party and play with sounds till heavens know. While Mr. Chris seeks for a world where he can be able to research and discover more findings about the existence of things and find solutions to the unknown.  The two individuals are all involved in the game of civilization and they are seeking for a way to better and fulfill their goals and objective but they have contradicting and conflicting goals, while one seek or enjoy life to the fullest, the other seek to find truth about knowledge on how and why thins exist. 
Consequently, we can’t say that Mr. Chris is more important then Mr. Roy in the game because players have different purpose in the game, that is where the drive for value diversity sets in.

What is value diversity? 

Values is a principle or standard, as of behaviour, that is considered important or desirable or that which is desirable or worthy of esteem for its own sake; thing or quality having intrinsic worth. While, Diversity is about empowering people by respecting and appreciating what makes them different, in terms the game of civilization. Diversity in the game entails a variety of skills, qualifications, culture, and values come together as one. It can be a major challenge in the game with players where others have beliefs, values, and ideas different from yours. These differences can lead to resistance to leadership and changes due to a lack of trust and understanding.
Consequently, value diversity is the process of respecting the differences in goals and objectives of other players in the game. Players can have differences in ethnicity, gender, race, religion, socio-economic status, talents, lifestyle, opinions, perspectives, education, and a lot more. 

Value drift

Value drift refers to the change or "drift" that our values may undergo over time; we begin to care more about certain values and less about others. This can be a good thing; over time, we may become wiser and adopt more sensible positions in the game. As we grow and explore in our daily activities, players may increasingly drift in their opinion and position on how the game is to be played or positioned.  As seen in the book, “This Reflective Equilibrium shows value drift within one player. Different players will come to very different answers - if they seek them at all - so values across them may further drift”. 


Convergence

Convergence simply put, means the act of converging and especially moving toward union or uniformity. That is, accepting a particular way on how the game is to be played or While peacefully coexisting, we also want to amplify cooperation for mutual benefit. With diverse values that increasingly drift apart, we can’t rely on aligning players on one grand strategy. Players have different aspirations and objectives. As players are bound to conflict in their actions and inactions towards decision making.

MY VIEW

If we are to look at what dynamic drive value diversity, drift or convergence? I would strongly choose the both, because in the game of civilization we will surely agree to disagree. For instance, in certain decision making we the players might encounter difficulties(drift) in arriving at a particular decision thereby making us to rethink our intentions by finding a way to dialogue(Convergence) through voluntary cooperation, that is, the players considering the fact that they can actually coexist in their different fields without any need for conflicts and violence which is called pareto preferred by making decisions that will not go against another player goals and aspirations.
	If Mr. Chris wants to create an artificial intelligent that would monitor our location and activities, he should take into consideration that Mr. Roy enjoys privacy and non interference in his daily activities which will make them to consider the limits in which the proposed artificial intelligent should reach in checking another players activities and privacy. Simply put, “You’re in this game of civilization with players who have a diversity of values. Some values are complementary(Convergence), some opposing(drift), and some include the destruction of the playing field.”
